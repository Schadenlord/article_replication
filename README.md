# Final Project ‚Äì Econometrics III

Welcome to the repository for the final project of Econometrics III. This project is a rigorous replication and extension of a published empirical article, designed to demonstrate advanced econometric modeling, critical analysis, and best practices in reproducible research.

---

## üìö Overview

This repository contains:

- **Replicated Article Analysis:** A scholarly report presenting the replication results, additional insights, and methodological commentary.
- **Original Reference Article:** The published paper that serves as the benchmark for replication.
- **Replication Data:** The dataset utilized for all analyses, provided in Stata format for seamless integration with econometric software.
- **Codebase:** Stata `.do` files and Jupyter Notebooks for full transparency and reproducibility of all empirical results.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

- `Trabalho como Artigo.pdf`: The main article, written in academic format, detailing objectives, methodology, results, and critical discussion.
- `Contemporary Economic Policy.pdf`: The original reference article.
- `Replication data.dta`: Stata-formatted dataset for replication.
- `Replication_code.do`: Stata code for exact replication of the original empirical results.
- `Completo - Final.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook providing stepwise analysis, data visualization, and supplementary econometric commentary.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Schadenlord/article_replication.git
cd article_replication
```

### 2. Reproduce the Results

- **Stata:**  
  Open `Replication_code.do` in Stata and execute it using the provided `Replication data.dta` to reproduce the main tables and results from the reference article.
- **Jupyter Notebook:**  
  Launch `Completo - Final.ipynb` to explore an interactive, annotated walkthrough of the replication process, including additional robustness checks and advanced diagnostics.

### 3. Review the Documentation

- **Read** `Trabalho como Artigo.pdf` for a comprehensive narrative of the replication process and expanded analysis.
- **Compare** with `Contemporary Economic Policy.pdf` to assess fidelity and methodological choices.

## üß† Technical Notes

This project assumes familiarity with:

- **Panel Data Models**: Fixed and random effects, specification testing (e.g., Hausman test), and implications for causal inference.
- **Robustness Checks**: Heteroskedasticity-consistent errors, omitted variable diagnostics, and sensitivity analyses.
- **Reproducibility**: All code is provided for transparent replication and extension. Notebooks are heavily annotated for clarity.

**Key best practices implemented:**
- Version control and literate programming via Jupyter Notebooks.
- Clear separation between data, scripts, and written analysis.
- All tables and figures are generated dynamically from code, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- **Stata** (for `.do` execution)
- **Python 3.x** with recommended libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `statsmodels`
  - `jupyter`
- Optional: LaTeX distribution (for compiling academic reports)
